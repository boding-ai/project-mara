          One day, sometime ago, while working on an in-house wellness app we got to know from a doctor friend of ours just how expensive, difficult and rather frustrating process it is to setup a software for their clinic and that they were better off without one. 
          
          We thought pretty hard about this and decided to conduct our own research about the kind of software, doctors (both veterinarians and human) were using. And the results were utterly disappointing. This is what we found: 

          <ol>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Why
